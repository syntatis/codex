A codebase designed to build WordPress extensions with modern PHP practices.

## Why?

WordPress is a powerful platform, but while PHP has evolved over the years, WordPress development has largely stayed the same. Modern PHP practices like Autoloading with [Composer](https://getcomposer.org) and Dependency Injection aren't commonly used when building WordPress extensions. This situation has caused some gaps between WordPress and the rest of the PHP ecosystem.

This project aims to close that gap by offering functions and classes that make it easier to build WordPress extensions with modern PHP techniques.

## Inspiration

This project is inspired by the following projects:

- [Illuminate: The Laravel Components](https://github.com/illuminate)
- [Symfony: Reusable PHP components](https://github.com/symfony)
