## Why?

WordPress is a powerful platform, but while PHP has evolved over the years, WordPress development has largely stayed the same. Modern PHP practices like Autoloading with [Composer](https://getcomposer.org) and Dependency Injection aren't commonly used when building extensions for WordPress. It has caused some gaps between WordPress and the rest of the PHP ecosystem.

This project aims to close the gap by providing functions, classes, and structure as the foundation to build extensions for WordPress with a slightly modern PHP approach.

## Inspiration
