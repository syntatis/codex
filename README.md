A codebase designed to build extensions for WordPressÂ® with modern PHP practices.

## Why?

WordPress is a powerful platform, but while PHP has evolved over the years, WordPress development has largely stayed the same. Modern PHP practices like Autoloading with [Composer](https://getcomposer.org) and Dependency Injection aren't commonly used when building extensions for WordPress. It has caused some gaps between WordPress and the rest of the PHP ecosystem.

This project aims to close the gap by providing functions, classes, and structure as the foundation to build extensions for WordPress with modern PHP techniques.

## Projects

List of projects built on top of **Codex** as their foundation.

- ðŸ§ª ðŸ‘‹ [howdy](https://github.com/syntatis/howdy): Build your next modern plugin for WordPressÂ®.
- ðŸ§ª âœ¨ [howdy-open-ai](https://github.com/syntatis/howdy-open-ai): Build your next modern plugin for WordPressÂ® with OpenAI integration.

## Providers

Additional services for the Codex service container.
